      Hello my name is Elii Skeans. I've created this website to showcase some of the skillsets I have 
      acquired from a mixture of university degrees, work experience and professional development. 
      <br><br>
      I have a strong desire to solve complex data problems and have a specific passion for mapping and visualizations. In the various roles I've had I always seek out and want to help solve the big challenges my team are facing.
      <br><br>
      Most recently, I worked for 5 years as a Reservoir Engineer for a consulting firm. Working for a small company allowed for the development and application of many different skills as I often wore many hats. 
      Besides working on technical reservoir engineering problems I handled large amounts of data frequently. During this role I earned a M.S. Data Analytics where access to large data sets allowed me to apply my skills 
      immediately on real projects. 
      <br/><br/>
      I continue to progress my skillsets via professional development with a focus on overcoming challenges in big data storage, analysis and visualizations.
      <br><br><br><br>
